# About

Circumstances have forced me to spend a lot of time with myself. I've joked multiple times about "listening to the voices" yet it isn't that much of a joke. Hence, "we" have opinions.

I am a technology architect. An architect takes **everything** into consideration in order to design and suggest. And this exercise leaves the architect with a way of thinking, mental models, a mindset. 

I see my craft in my life, every day: it's everywhere. This compilation of thoughts are not about technology, yet they're heavily influenced by it since
that's the information I consume the most. I didn't write them down particularly for anybody. I wrote them down for myself, but I'd happily [discuss them with anybody](mailto:cespin@live.ca).

I would call this a public personal diary. My life compass. An attempt to explain myself the order of things. A decoder that the journey through my profession has left me with. A universal codec.
