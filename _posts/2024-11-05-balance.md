title: Balance.
lead: Two equals one

There's always two. They oppose and complement each other. Together they transform into something new.

Active and passive. When balanced, there's dynamic equilibrium. When unbalanced, there's chaos.

Brooke in the Mythical Man-Month says that there's thinkers and doers. But there's also thinkers-doers: the unicorns. And that's who we should strive to be.

Search and acknowledge the passive and the active forces within the context. Balance them.
